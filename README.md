# Repo for a New Honiton Repair Cafe Website
I am using this repo temporarily for a developmental version of a website that I may end up creating for real.
The current website is [here](https://www.honitoncag.co.uk/).

## How is this site made?
The site is made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the the [Hextra Theme](https://github.com/imfing/hextra).

## Where is the website hosted?
It is hosted [right here](https://compact105.github.io/) using a free domain provided by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
